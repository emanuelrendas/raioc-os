/**
 * Rate limiting for the inbound write routes.
 *
 * Recovered from dld-update-website (donor ref
 * 815e0469043a04f5229bc056b540b6a96ce0dd6a) as part of MISSION P1-A —
 * Canonical Website Lead Ingress Reconciliation. No canonical equivalent
 * existed in raioc-os prior to this mission (verified: no rate-limit
 * references anywhere under src/ or api/).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
 *
 * The counter lives in the memory of one serverless instance. Vercel runs
 * several instances per region and recycles them, so a determined flood
 * spread across warm instances gets more through than the limit implies.
 * This stops a single source hammering one endpoint — a stuck retry loop,
 * a script, a form resubmitted a hundred times — which is what the write
 * routes are actually exposed to today.
 *
 * It is not a defence against a distributed attack. That needs a limiter
 * with shared state (Upstash, Vercel KV, or Supabase itself) and belongs
 * with whoever owns the infrastructure budget. Not introduced here by
 * design (P1-A scope).
 *
 * Fails open. If the bookkeeping throws, the request proceeds: losing a
 * genuine lead costs more than admitting one extra request.
